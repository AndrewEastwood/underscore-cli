%># Overview

JSON is an excellent data interchange format and rapidly becoming the preferred format for Web APIs.
Thusfar, most of the tools to process it are very limited.  Yet, when working in Javascript, JSON is fluid and natural.

<b>Why can't command-line Javascript be easy?</b>

Underscore-CLI can be a simple pretty printer:

    cat data.json | underscore print

Or it can form the backbone of a rich, full-powered Javascript command-line, inspired by "perl -pe", and doing for structured data what sed, awk, and grep do for text.

    cat example-data/earthporn.json | underscore extract 'data.children' | underscore pluck data | underscore pluck title

See [Real World Example] (#real_world_example) for the output and more examples.

### Underscore-CLI is:

 * **FLEXIBLE** - THE "swiss-army-knife" tool for processing JSON data - can be used as a simple pretty-printer, or as a full-powered Javascript command-line
 * **POWERFUL** - Exposes the full power and functionality of [underscore.js] (http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/) (plus [underscore.string] (https://github.com/epeli/underscore.string), [json:select](http://jsonselect.org/#overview), and [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/))
 * **SIMPLE** - Makes it simple to write JS one-liners similar to using "perl -pe"
 * **CHAINED** - Multiple command invokations can be chained together to create a data processing pipeline
 * **MULTI-FORMAT** - Rich support for input / output formats - pretty-printing, strict JSON, etc.  See [Data Formats] (#data_formats)
 * **DOCUMENTED** - Excellent command-line documentation with multiple examples for every command

### A Bit More Explanation ...

Underscore-CLI is built on [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/#download), which is less than a 4M download and [very easy to install](#installing_node).  Node.js is rapidly gaining mindshare as a tool for writing scalable services in Javascript.

Unfortutately, out-of-the-box, Node.js is a pretty horrible as a command-line tool.  This is what it takes to simply echo stdin:

    cat foo.json | node -e '
      var data = "";
      process.stdin.setEncoding("utf8");
      process.stdin.on("data", function (d) {
        data = data + d;
      });
      process.stdin.on("end", function () {
        // put all your code here
        console.log(data);
      });
      process.stdin.resume();
    '

Ugly.  Underscore-CLI handles all the verbose boilerplate, making it easy to do simple data manipulations:

    echo '[1, 2, 3, 4]' | underscore process 'map(data, function (value) { return value+1 })'

If you are used to seeing "_.map", note that because we arn't worried about keeping the global namespace clean, [many useful functions](dead_link_for_now) (including all of underscore.js) are exposed as globals.

Of course 'mapping' a function to a dataset is super common, so as a shortcut, it's exposed as a first-class command, and the expression you provide is auto-wrapped in "function (value, key, list) { return ... }".

    echo '[1, 2, 3, 4]' | underscore map 'value+1'

Also, while you can pipe data in, if the data is just a string like the example above, there's a shortcut for that too:

    underscore -d '[1, 2, 3, 4]' map 'value+1'

Or if it's stored in a file, and you want to write the output to another file:

    underscore -i data.json map 'value+1' -o output.json

Here's what it takes to increment the minor version number for an NPM package (straight from our Makefile):

    underscore -i package.json process 'vv=data.version.split("."),vv[2]++,data.version=vv.join("."),data' -o package.json

### Installing Node (command-line javascript)

Installing Node is easy.  It's only a 4M download:

[Download Node](http://nodejs.org/#download)

Alternatively, if you do [homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/), you can:

    brew install node

For more details on what node is, see [this StackOverflow thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1884724/what-is-node-js/6782438#6782438)

### Installing
    npm install -g underscore-cli
    underscore help

# Documentation

<a name="usage"/>
### Usage

If you run the tool without any arguments, this is what prints out:

<%= program.helpInformation().replace(/^/gm, '  ').replace(/\033\[[;0-9]*m/g, "") %>

<a name="data_formats"/>
### Data Formats

<%

_.map(formats, function (f, name) {

%>
#### <%= name %>

<%= f.description %>

<pre><code><%= f.stringify(sample).replace(/\033\[[;0-9]*m/g, "") %></code></pre>
<%

});

%>

<a name="real_world_example"/>

### Playing with data from a webservice

Let's play with a real data source, like http://www.reddit.com/r/earthporn.json.  For convenience (and consistent test results), an abbreviated version of this data is stored in example-data/earthporn.json.  Let's say you want a list of all the image titles ...

Using JSONSelect, this is trivial:

    cat example-data/earthporn.json | underscore select '.data .title'

Alternatively, you could do it the traditional way:

    cat example-data/earthporn.json | underscore extract 'data.children' | underscore pluck data | underscore pluck title

Which prints:

    [ 'Fjaðrárgljúfur canyon, Iceland [OC] [683x1024]',
      'New town, Edinburgh, Scotland [4320 x 3240]',
      'Sunrise in Bryce Canyon, UT [1120x700] [OC]',
      'Kariega Game Reserve, South Africa [3584x2688]',
      'Valle de la Luna, Chile [OS] [1024x683]',
      'Frosted trees after a snowstorm in Laax, Switzerland [OC] [1072x712]' ]


Hmm, I think I'd like code-worthy names for those images.

Underscore-CLI exposes the function from [underscore.js] (http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/) and [underscore.string] (https://github.com/epeli/underscore.string)) not only as first-class commands, but also within command-line Javascript expressions:

    cat earthporn.json | underscore select '.data .title' | underscore map 'camelize(value.replace(/\[.*\]/g,"")).replace(/[^a-zA-Z]/g,"")' --outfmt text

Which prints ...

    FjarrgljfurCanyonIceland
    NewTownEdinburghScotland
    SunriseInBryceCanyonUT
    KariegaGameReserveSouthAfrica
    ValleDeLaLunaChile
    FrostedTreesAfterASnowstormInLaaxSwitzerland

Try doing THAT with any other CLI one-liner!

### Version-bump in package.json

This one is straight out of our own [Makefile](https://github.com/ddopson/underscore-cli/blob/master/Makefile):

    underscore -i package.json process 'vv=data.version.split("."); vv[2]++; data.version=vv.join("."); data;' -o package.json

### Getting a greppable list of URLs fetched during the load of a website

This is one I did at work the other day.  Chrome --> Dev Console (CMD-OPT-J) --> Network Tab --> (right click context menu) --> Save All as HAR.  I have no idea why it's called a "HAR" file, but it's pure JSON data ... pretty verbose stuff, but I just want the urls ...

    cat site.har | underscore select '.url' --outfmt text | grep mydomain > urls.txt

Well, I'd also like to [ack](http://betterthangrep.com) through the contents of all those files.  Best to get a local snapshot of it all:

    cat urls.txt | while read line; do curl $line > $(echo $line | perl -pe 's/https?://([^?]*)[?]?.*/$1'); done

And I'm off to the races analyzing the behavior and load ordering of a complex production site that dynamically loads (literally) hundreds of individual resources off the network.  Sure, I could have viewed all that stuff inside Chrome, but I wanted a local directory-structured snapshot that I could serve on a local Nginx instance by adding entries in /etc/hosts that mapped the production domains to 127.0.0.1.  Now I can run the exact production site locally, make changes, and see what they would do.


Look at [Examples.md](https://github.com/ddopson/underscore-cli/blob/master/Examples.md) for a more comprehensive list of examples.
# Polish: 1001 Little Conveniences

### Templates as first class NPM modules - ie, real stack traces

When using the 'template' command, we go to great length to provide a fully debuggable experience.  We have a custom version of the template compilation code (templates are compiled to JS and then evaluated) that ensures a 1:1 mapping between line numbers in the original *.template file and line numbers in the generated JS code.  This code is then loaded as if it were a real Node.js module (literally, using a require() statement).  This means that should anything go wrong, the resulting stack traces and sytax exceptions will have correct line numbers from the original template file.

### Expressions auto-return the last value

This one is a bit [CoffeeScript](http://coffee-script.org) inspired.  When we parse command-line expressions for commands like 'map', they are evaluated as NodeScript objects.  This allows us to retrieve the last value in the expression.  In a previous version we wrapped expressions in function boilerplate; however this blocked the use of semicolons within an expression.  With first class Script objects, we can evaluate multiple semicolon delimited expressions and still capture the value from the last expression evaluated.  Thus, all of the following expressions will return "10".

    underscore run '5 + 5'
    underscore run 'x=5; y=5; x+y;'
    underscore run 'x=5, y=5, x+y;'

This even works to find the last evaluated value inside conditional branches (these also return 10):

    underscore run 'x=5; if (x > 0) { 10; } else { 0; }'           # last value is 10
    underscore run 'x=5; if (x > 0) { y=5; } else { y=-99; } x+y;' # last value is 'x+y' 

In general, the principle here is that you shouldn't have think to hard because the code should just return what you intuitively expect.

### Autodetection of CoffeeScript

TBI - as of this version, still need the '--coffee' flag :(

### Smart auto-consumption of STDIN

TBI - as of this version, if there is no data, we will block for reading STDIN.  We should only do this if the user expression refers to the well-known 'data' variable.  This would unify the 'process' and 'run' commands.

### Smart auto-detection of return value

TBI - as of this version, the last evaluated expression value is always returned.  However, sometimes, you want to mutate the existing data instead of returning a new value.  This should be easy.  If the expression does something like 'data.key = value', then the return value should be 'data'.  Today, you have to write 'data.key = value; data'.  I want that last part to be implicit, but only if you mutate the data variable.  And there should be a command-line flag "--retval={expr,data,auto}", with 'auto' being the default.

### Efficienct stream processing for set-oriented commands like 'map'

TBI - as of this version, all commands slurp the entire input stream and parse it before doing any data manipulation.  This works fine for the vast majority of scenarios, but if you actually had a 30GB JSON file, it would be a bit clunky.  For set-oriented commands like 'map', a smarter core engine plus a smarter JSON parser could enable stream-oriented processing where data processing occurs continuously as the input is read and streamed to the output without ever needing to store the entire dataset in memory at once.  This feature requires a custom JSON-parser and some serious fancy, but I'll get to it eventually.  If you have any performance-sensitive use-cases, post an issue on Github, and I'd be glad to work with you.

# Alternatives

* [jsonpipe] (https://github.com/dvxhouse/jsonpipe) - Python focused, w/ a featureset centered around a single scenario
* [jshon] (http://kmkeen.com/jshon/) - Has a lot of functions, but very terse
* [json-command] (https://github.com/zpoley/json-command) - very limited
* [TickTick] (https://github.com/kristopolous/TickTick) - Bash focused JSON manipulation.  Iteresting w/ heavy Bash integration. Complements this tool.
* [json] (https://github.com/trentm/json) - Similar idea.
* [jsawk] (https://github.com/micha/jsawk) - Similar idea. Uses a custom JS environment. Good technical documentation.
* [jsonpath] (http://code.google.com/p/jsonpath/wiki/Javascript) - this is not a CLI tool.  It's a runtime JS library.
* [json:select()] (http://jsonselect.org/#tryit) - this is not a CLI tool.  CSS-like selectors for JSON.  Very interesting idea.... now available as an Underscore-CLI command.

Please add a Github issue if I've missed any.
